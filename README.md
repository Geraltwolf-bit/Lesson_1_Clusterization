# Lesson_1_Clusterization
In this program, I clusterize users depending on their engagement
First, I drew a scatterplot that told me that my dataset contains three clusters of users: highly engaged, moderately engaged, and unengaged.
I scaled the data, applied KMean, and found out that the dataset indeed contains three clusters.
I created new scatterplot to confirm the result.
With the use of dicts, loops, and item() I displayed user_id's that belong to each cluster.
